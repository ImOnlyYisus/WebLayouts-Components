# Components design with HTML,CSS & JS
I proposed to do one component each day, and this is the result. ðŸ¤™
My idea was to grow up my abilities of webs layouts and also have components to reuse on other projects.

### List of components
* [Card github repo](#card-github-repo-go)
* [Isomtric menu](#isometric-menu-go)
* [Reto #1 ManzDev](#reto-1-manzdev-go)
